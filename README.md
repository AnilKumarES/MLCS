# Machine learning in CyberSecurity
Projects for ML in CyberSecurity course Saarland University WS 2018/19

Repository Contains the following items:
1. Project_1
2. Project_2
3. Project_3 with report


#### Project_1:
A digit classifier is implemented based on the popular [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset. The dataset is based on a seminal [paper](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf), which immensely popularized (convolutional) neural networks. This is a great starting point for ML research and this dataset/model has been a stepping stone for numerous other tasks such as [GANs](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf), [Adversarial Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572)


#### Project_2:
Contains an implementation of Evasion attack (craft adversarial examples) and also defence of the model

#### Proejct_3:
The goal of this project (and the competition) is: given a dataset based on varied properties of different Windows machines, to be able to predict a particular machine's probability of getting infected by malware.
